# HealthChatBot
This is a lightweight mental health assistant chatbot that runs entirely offline on your local machine. It detects the emotional tone of user input using TextBlob sentiment analysis, and then generates an empathetic and supportive response using a local large language model (LLM) powered by Ollama â€” such as llama3.2
